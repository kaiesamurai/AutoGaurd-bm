# AutoGuard: Autonomous DeFi Position Management

## Inspiration
Managing DeFi positions can be highly time-consuming and requires constant vigilance to react to market movements. This inspired us to create a solution that autonomously handles these tasks, allowing users to benefit from automated position management without the need for continuous monitoring.

## What it Does
AutoGuard provides a decentralized and autonomous way to manage DeFi positions. It enables users to create automated tasks such as Stop Loss actions, which are triggered based on the evolution of asset prices. This ensures that users' investments are managed efficiently and safely without manual intervention.

## How We Built It
AutoGuard was built using a combination of several powerful protocols:
- **Gelato**: For automating the execution of smart contracts.
- **Chainlink**: For reliable and tamper-proof price references.
- **Uniswap**: As the decentralized exchange for trading.
- **InstaDapp**: For advanced DeFi smart account management.

Our tech stack includes:
- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **Solidity**

We integrated these technologies to ensure seamless interaction and automation of DeFi tasks, providing a robust and user-friendly experience.

## Challenges We Ran Into
One of the significant challenges was integrating multiple protocols and ensuring they work together seamlessly. Each protocol has its own set of complexities, and coordinating them required extensive testing and debugging. Additionally, ensuring real-time data accuracy and execution reliability was critical to the success of the project.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We are proud to have developed a mainnet-ready application that can autonomously execute Stop Loss orders on DeFi assets. This is a significant step towards providing users with a reliable and automated tool for managing their DeFi investments. Successfully integrating complex protocols and achieving a functional product is a milestone we are very proud of.

## What We Learned
Throughout the development of AutoGuard, we gained valuable insights and knowledge about:
- The Gelato protocol and its capabilities for automating tasks.
- Chainlink's price reference feeds and their importance in ensuring accurate and reliable data.
- Uniswap's decentralized exchange operations and how to leverage them for automated trading.
- InstaDapp's DeFi smart account functionalities and their role in advanced position management.

## What's Next for AutoGuard
Our future plans for AutoGuard include:
- Adding new types of automated tasks and expanding the functionality to handle a wider range of DeFi strategies.
- Enhancing the front-end to provide a more robust and user-friendly interface.
- Exploring integration with additional DeFi protocols to offer more comprehensive position management solutions.
- Focusing on security enhancements to ensure user funds are protected at all times.
- Deploying the solution on multiple blockchains to increase accessibility and reach a broader audience.
